## Our approach {#approach}

Our work is grounded in values of equality, social justice and meaningful participation.

- **Participant-centred.** We design research and evaluation that is accessible, inclusive and safe, particularly when working with children and young people.  
- **Co-production & co-design.** Wherever possible we involve participants, practitioners and communities in shaping questions, methods and how findings are shared.  
- **Positive impact.** We focus on generating insights that can genuinely improve policies, programmes and everyday practice, not just fill a report.  
- **Giving back.** Each year we commit time to a number of pro bono projects with small local charities whose work aligns with our values.
