## Our approach {#approach}

Our work is grounded in values of equality, social justice and meaningful participation.

- **Participant-centred.** We design research and evaluation that is accessible, inclusive and safe, particularly when working with children and young people.  
- **Co-production & co-design.** Wherever possible we involve participants, practitioners and communities in shaping questions, methods and how findings are shared.  
- **Positive impact.** We focus on generating insights that can genuinely improve policies, programmes and everyday practice, not just fill a report.  
- **Giving back.** Each year we commit time to a number of pro bono projects with small local charities whose work aligns with our values.

## Case studies {#case-studies}

Here are two examples of the kind of work we do.

<div class="case-studies-grid">

  <div class="case-card">
    <h3>Strengthening evaluation for a national education programme</h3>
    <p class="case-meta">National public body · Multi-year programme</p>
    <p>
      We worked with partners to co-design a monitoring, evaluation and learning framework for a large-scale
      education initiative, involving thousands of young people and multiple delivery organisations. The work
      included a logic model, outcomes framework, accessible tools for practitioners and clear reporting to
      senior decision-makers.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="case-card">
    <h3>Participant-centred insight for a local charity</h3>
    <p class="case-meta">Local charity · Children and young people</p>
    <p>
      A small youth charity asked us to help understand how their services were experienced by children and
      families. We developed inclusive, age-appropriate methods, supported staff to gather feedback confidently,
      and produced practical recommendations that fed directly into service design.
